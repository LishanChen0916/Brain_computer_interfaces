# Brain_computer_interfaces

Brain computer interfaces (BCI), enables direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signals. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.  
For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs.
